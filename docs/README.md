# Welcome to Bot-Machine

Welcome to the official documentation for the `bot-machine` framework.

`bot-machine` is a lightweight and modern framework for building Telegram bots, inspired by Express.js and React. It is designed with a schema-first and AI-driven development workflow in mind, resulting in a highly predictable, robust, and maintainable architecture.

## Where to Start

- **New to `bot-machine`?** The **[Guides](./guides/01-introduction.md)** are the best place to start. They will walk you through the core concepts and help you build your first bot.
- **Looking for specific API details?** The **[API Reference](./api-reference/README.md)** provides detailed information on every part of the framework.

## Core Philosophy

This framework is built on two key principles to optimize for both human and AI developers:

1.  **Schema-First Data Contracts:** All boundaries between system components (e.g., UI and business logic) are defined by machine-readable schemas (using Zod), eliminating ambiguity.
2.  **Type-Safe State Transitions:** State machines and routers eliminate "magic strings" in favor of type-safe, discoverable APIs for defining states and transitions.

This approach leads to a development experience that is fast, safe, and enjoyable.
